# SafeChild_Hackwhiz
A social impact project using Microsoft Azure to detect and protect vulnerable children through AI-driven reporting and governance visibility.

In India, millions of orphaned and vulnerable children remain unseen by governance systems, making them easy prey for
child labour, trafficking, and abuse. The problem is not only of poverty but of invisibility. For example, in West Bengal and
Jharkhand, trafficking rings exploit children who are never formally recorded in welfare schemes. During COVID-19, more
than 1 lakh children lost a parent, yet many slipped through the cracks of state support – forced into labour or begging at
railway stations and city markets. Citizens and NGOs often witness such cases, but there is no simple digital bridge to connect
them with authorities in real time.
This is where “Safe Child” or “Muskaan Suraksha” becomes urgent and necessary. By leveraging Smart Governance and
Digital India principles, it transforms child protection from reactive to proactive. Through AI-driven triage, multilingual
voice/text reporting, and real-time mapping, Safe child empowers communities to raise alerts instantly, while providing district
officials and NGOs with live dashboards for intervention and policy action.
